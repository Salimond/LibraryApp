Basic library app with a very rudimentary user interface - data handling is a bit of a mess and there's no real user feedback, but basic functionality is there.

Todo - clean up how data is handled, dodgy relationships between user and books that can be done much more elegantly
     - implement proper factory creation
     - finish unit tests for books and write some for users
     - error handling in the front end
